name: code_output_guidelines
description: Rules for including necessary imports, comments for significant changes, and handling large files, plus adherence to VS Code docs.

# Actual guidelines:
- Include all necessary imports, declarations, and surrounding code to ensure the file is complete and functional
- Provide comments or explanations for significant changes or additions within the file
- If the file is too large to reasonably include in full, provide the most relevant complete section and clearly indicate where it fits in the larger file structure

Follow VS Code Extension documentation for best practices
