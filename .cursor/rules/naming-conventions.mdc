Establishes conventions for naming files, directories, variables, and functions.

<rule>
name: naming_conventions
description: Guidelines for PascalCase, kebab-case, test file naming, and camelCase for variables/functions.

# Actual guidelines:
- Use PascalCase only for files that export a single class or Svelte component (TutorialPanel.ts, NavBar.svelte)
- Use lowercase with dash for file names and directories(e.g., content-script.js, background-worker.js)
- Use '*.test.ts' for test files
- Use camelCase for function and variable names
</rule>
