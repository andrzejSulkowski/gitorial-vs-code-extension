# Extension Manifest (`package.json`)

Guidelines for maintaining a clear and efficient `package.json` file.

<rule>
name: extension_manifest_package_json
description: Best practices for defining contribution points, specific activation events, and clear display name/description.

# Actual guidelines:
- Keep contribution points (commands, views, configurations, keybindings, etc.) clearly defined and documented.
- Ensure `activationEvents` are as specific as possible to improve extension startup performance.
- Provide a clear and concise `displayName` and `description`.
