name: context_aware_development
description: Stresses considering project context, avoiding duplication, ensuring seamless integration, and reviewing existing state.

# Actual guidelines:
- Always consider the whole project context when providing suggestions or generating code
- Avoid duplicating existing functionality or creating conflicting implementations
- Ensure that new code integrates seamlessly with the existing project structure and architecture
- Before adding new features or modifying existing ones, review the current project state to maintain consistency and avoid redundancy
- When answering questions or providing solutions, take into account previously discussed or implemented features to prevent contradictions or repetitions
