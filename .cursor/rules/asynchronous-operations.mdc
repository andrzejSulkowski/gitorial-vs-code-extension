# Asynchronous Operations

Best practices for handling asynchronous code in VS Code extensions.

<rule>
name: asynchronous_operations
description: Recommends async/await, graceful Promise rejection handling, and awareness of async callback execution context.

# Actual guidelines:
- Use `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous code.
- Handle Promise rejections gracefully to prevent unhandled errors.
- Be aware of the execution context of asynchronous callbacks, especially when interacting with UI elements or VS Code APIs that expect to be run on the extension host.
