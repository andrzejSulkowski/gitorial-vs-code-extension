# Minimal Working Examples

Guidelines for providing runnable code that demonstrates core functionality without unnecessary complexity.

<rule>
name: minimal_working_examples
description: Ensures that code examples are minimal, runnable, and focused on demonstrating core functionality without extra features or extensive error handling.

# Actual guidelines:
- Provide minimal working examples that compile or run immediately without modification
- Include only what's strictly necessary to demonstrate the core idea or functionality
- Omit extra features, extensive error handling, logging, or polishing beyond basic functionality
- Focus on creating a runnable proof of concept that can be built upon
- Avoid over-engineering; the goal is to show the essential implementation pattern
- Include necessary imports, basic type definitions, and minimal setup code required for compilation
- Prefer simple, direct implementations over complex abstractions in examples
- Leave advanced logic, edge-case handling, and optimizations for the user to add later
</rule>
